h1. Caprese

Caprese (pronounced ca-PRAY-zay) is a helper app for the "Mac OS X Pomodoro App":http://pomodoro.ugolandini.com/Mac by Ugo Landini.  It provides an easy-to-configure suite of actions that can be executed and unexecuted when your Pomodoro starts and stops.  Actions include:

* Set adium status for all accounts
* Announce pomodoro status to campfire
* Launch applications, hiding all other windows
* Quit applications
* Block applications
* Block domains (blocks by IP using the Mac OS X firewall)

h2. sudo access

I recommend putting this in /var/caprese, chowning it as root, and giving yourself NOPASSWD sudo access to it by adding these lines to your sudoers file (edit it with visudo!)

  %admin  ALL=PASSWD: ALL, NOPASSWD: /opt/caprese/caprese

If you opt out of sudo, Block domains will not work, and block applications may not work (depending on your permissions).

h2. Gem dependencies

Use <code>sudo geminstaller</code> to make sure you have the needed gems. Also, you will want to make sure that you are using your System-supplied version of ruby, and not your custom built version, as Mac OS X will likely ignore your path settings and pick the System-supplied.

I recommend:

<pre>
  cd path_to_caprese
  sudo /usr/bin/gem install geminstaller
  sudo /usr/bin/geminstaller
</pre>

h2. Configure

copy <code>/opt/caprese/config.rb.sample</code> to <code>/opt/caprese/config.rb</code>.  This is how you can configure the various actions.

h2. Test

Test out your configuration in the command line by running

<pre>
  sudo /opt/caprese/caprese start POMODORO_DESCRIPTION="test description"

  sudo /opt/caprese/caprese stop
</pre>

h2. Integrating with Pomodoro.app

Go to the config -> applescript.

Put this in "start" :

<pre>
  do shell script "sudo /opt/caprese/caprese start POMODORO_DESCRIPTION=\"$pomodoroName\" POMODORO_DURATION=$duration"
</pre>

Put this in "reset" and "end" :

<pre>
  do shell script "sudo /opt/caprese/caprese stop"
</pre>

Be sure to check the checkboxes next to "start", "reset", and "end" to tell Pomodoro.app to actually execute those scripts.
